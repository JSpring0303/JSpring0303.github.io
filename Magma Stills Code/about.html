            <div class="where-con">
                <p>Magma Stills came into being three generations ago, thanks to a group of three mates who set up their 
                first-ever distillation setup close to a geothermal vent nestled in the volcanic region of Auckland Harbour. 
                After noticing that the special geothermal heat lent their Gin a remarkable and captivating flavor, 
                the enterprising trio realized they had stumbled upon something rare and valuable. 
                Driven by the desire to share their exceptional spirits with everyone, they launched the renowned Magma Stills brand.
